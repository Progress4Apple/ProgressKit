     Configuration method which initializes the ProgressKit framework for usage in your own app.
     
     - parameter suiteName: A string that names the group whose shared directory you want to obtain. This input should exactly match one of the strings in the app's [App Groups Entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_application-groups).
     - parameter userNotificationCenter: The central object for managing notification-related activities for your app or app extension. Usually you just want to use `UNUserNotificationCenter.current()`.
     - parameter giphyApiKey: A string containing the Giphy Api Key to use. See [Request A GIPHY API Key](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020283431-Request-A-GIPHY-API-Key) to obtain one.
